# ⏳ Lifery Bot

A Telegram bot that reminds you of the transience of time by visualizing the weeks of your life lived. Inspired by Stoic philosophy and the concept of Memento Mori.

> "Remember death to truly live."

## 🚀 Features
* 📅 **Life Calendar:** The user enters their birth date, and the bot calculates the weeks lived (based on an average lifespan of 4680 weeks).
* 🔔 **Weekly Reminders:** Every Monday at 12:00 UTC, users receive a notification with the number of weeks passed and a curated reminder from RU/EN content banks.
* 🌍 **Auto-Localization:** Automatically detects the user's language (EN/RU) based on Telegram settings.
* 🛡 **Robust Architecture:** Fully asynchronous code, resilient to high loads, restarts, and network failures.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Python 3.13+**
* **python-telegram-bot** (Async version + JobQueue)
* **PostgreSQL** (Database)
* **SQLAlchemy + asyncpg** (Asynchronous ORM)
* **Docker & Docker Compose** (Containerization)

## ✍️ Content
Weekly reminder copy is stored in curated JSON content banks:
* `bot/content/weekly_phrases_ru.json`
* `bot/content/weekly_phrases_en.json`

The bot reads full ready-to-send phrases from these files. Phrases are unique within each content bank; if a user's week number is higher than the current bank size, the bot cycles through the bank until more phrases are added.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Git

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notkurrent/lifery.git

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file from the example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and populate it with your credentials:
* `BOT_TOKEN`: Get it from @BotFather
